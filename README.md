TSAssetsPickerController is a control for iOS which works very similar to `UIImagePickerController`. It has an elegant and carefully designed classes.

# Overview
TSAssetsPickerController is a controller you can use to select multiple assets (ALAsset objects).

#### Features

- Browse all albums
- Asset filtering (type, size)
- Supports all orientations
- Supports iOS6, iOS7
- Supports iPhone, iPad
- Allows to select multiple assets from one album
- Customizable order of albums and assets,
- Plenty of options to set.
- Easy to apply in your project
- Easy to customize
<br><br>

# API Quickstart
There is few topics you should know about. Most important classes are `TSAssetsPickerController`, its `delegate` and `dataSource`, `TSFilter` with `TSSizePredicate` class, and UI classes which you can subclass to customize TSAssetsPickerController's UI.

TSAssetsPickerController uses `TSAssetsPickerControllerDelegate` and `TSAssetsPickerControllerDataSource`.

<br>
## TSAssetsPickerControllerDelegate
Delegate has methods which your class have to implements. These methods are called when user finish picking assets, when user tapped cancel and when error occurs. 

Method with error is called when user prohibits access to its Camera Roll. 

Method which is called when user finished picking assets returns ALAssets objects. You can simply get picture or video from those ALAsset objects.
<br><br>

### TSAssetsPickerControllerDataSource
Data source has plenty of methods that are used to configure TAssetsPickerController. With data source you can set **number of items to select** and **filter** (`TSFilter` described later) which are required method of data source which your class have to implements.

Optional methods allow to set **title for albums view**, **title of cancel button**, **title of select button** and **text for cell which is visible when no albums is available**.

Other optional methods allows to **reverse order** of **albums** and/or **assets**, determine if **empty albums should be visible or not**, and if yes, if **should dimm title of empty albums**.

Last but not least is method you should use to **set subclasses for classes which you can customize**.
<br><br>


#### Classes to subclass
Following table describes clases which you can subclass.

| Class name | Description |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| `AlbumCell` | Base class of cel which is displayed of `TSAlbumsViewController` - cell with album name. |
| `NoAlbumsCell` | Base class of cell which is displayed on `TSAlbumsViewController` when there is no albums to display. |
| `AssetsFlowLayout` | Base class of flow layout used in `TSAssetsViewController`. Remember to not override `-itemSize` method. Size of item is read from `[AssetCell preferedCellSize]` automatically. |
| `AssetsCollectionView` | Base class of `UICollectionView` used in `TSAssetsViewController`. |


### TSFilter and TSSizePredicate
`TSFilter` is used by `TSAssetsPickerControllerDataSource` in method `- (TSFilter *)filterOfAssetsPickerController:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker`. Instance of this class determines what sort of assets and whith which options assets should be filtered. It's very simple to use. 

Instance may be created with filter (`Photo`, `Video`, `All`) and (optional) with one or more predicates.

Filter type is used to set if TSAssetsPickerController should shows only photos, videos or both of them. 

Filter can also takes `TSSizePredicate` object which determines which assets of which sizes should be visible. 

<br>
`TSSizePredicate` can match:

- if assets is equal to size,
- if assets is equal to one of few sizes,
- if assets size is less (or equal) than declared size,
- if assets size is greater (or equal) than declared size,

The most extensive designed initializer has ability to set logic gate. It is used to set more specific filters. You can set filter which accepts assets which are **less than 512x512 AND greater than 256x256**, or you can create filter which accepts assets **less than 512x512 OR greater than 1024x1024**. With simpler predicate you can set that picker should only accepts assets looks like screenshots by setting predicate which match array of sizes e.g. **640x1136, 1136x640, 640x960, 960x640**, etc. There is plenty of posibilites to set filter.

`TSSizePredicate` accepts array of CGSize objects contained in NSValue objects. TSSizePredicate share macro `TSSizeValue(width,height)`.

# Examples
Creating `TSAssetsPickerControllerInstnce`.
```objective-c
    _picker = [TSAssetsPickerController new];
    _picker.delegate = self;
    _picker.dataSource = self;
```
To responds to actions performed by picker class must implements few picker delegate's methods.
```objective-c
    #pragma mark - TSAssetsPickerControllerDelegate
    - (void)assetsPickerControllerDidCancel:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
        [_picker dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    }

    - (void)assetsPickerController:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assets {
        [_picker dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
        [DummyAssetsImporter importAssets:assets]; // Here is some class which gets data from ALAssets objects pass into.
    }

    - (void)assetsPickerController:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker failedWithError:(NSError *)error {
        if (error) {
            NSLog(@"Error occurs. Show dialog or something. Probably because user blocked access to Camera Roll.");
        }
    }
```
Two methods of picker's data source have to be also implemented.
```objective-c
    - (NSUInteger)numberOfItemsToSelectInAssetsPickerController:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
        return 3;
    }

    - (TSFilter *)filterOfAssetsPickerController:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
        TSSizePredicate *predicate = [TSSizePredicate matchSize:CGSizeMake(320, 480)];
        return [TSFilter filterWithType:FilterTypePhoto predicate:predicate];
    }
```
Optional methods of data source.
```objective-c
    - (NSString *)assetsPickerControllerTitleForAlbumsView:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
	    return @"Albums";
    }
	
    - (NSString *)assetsPickerControllerTitleForCancelButtonInAlbumsView:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
        return @"Cancel";
    }
	
    - (NSString *)assetsPickerControllerTitleForSelectButtonInAssetsView:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
	    return @"Select";
    }
	
    - (NSString *)assetsPickerControllerTextForCellWhenNoAlbumsAvailable:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
	    return @"Can't find any asset. Create some and back.";
    }
	
    - (BOOL)assetsPickerControllerShouldShowEmptyAlbums:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
	    return YES;
    }
	
    - (BOOL)assetsPickerControllerShouldDimmCellsForEmptyAlbums:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
        return NO;
    }
	
    - (BOOL)assetsPickerControllerShouldReverseAlbumsOrder:(TSAssetsPickerController *)picker {
	    return YES;
    }
```
# Requirements
`TSAssetsPickerController` needs ARC and works only on iOS6 and iOS7.
<br><br>
# Instalation
To install and use `TSAssetsPickerController` you have to add `Classes` directory to your project. If it's not from [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) there should be three folder inside `Controllers`, `Customizable Classes` and `API Classes`. After that you need import `TSAssetsPickerController`. It import all needed to work classes.

    #import "TSAssetsPickerController.h"
    

### via CocoaPods
`TSAssetsPickerControlller` is also available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

    pod 'TSAssetsPickerController'
